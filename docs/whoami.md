# WhoAmI

Hi, I'm Nil Torres a professional in the CyberSecurity space. Graduated a few years ago in a degree on 
Telecommunications and Masters in CyberSecurity management. Right now I have my focus on Cloud Security but in the past 
I have done a few pentests, mostly regarding mobile applications.

I will probably focus this site to my hobby side, so I don't thing you will find anything professional here. 
I learned most of my sysadmin and programming skills from tinkering with Telecogresca servers and applications but the 
real mvps are the giants that made IT shine in Telecogresca a few years ago. 
Thanks for the code left behind Arnau Alcázar and Àlex Barceló

With my recently bought ChromeBox 4 I have a few cool projects in mind so hopefully I will document them here soon.

Just as a quick list for myself, and nothing I promise working on soon, this is my project list:

- Asus ChromeBox 4  Deffy configuration and installation of Ubuntu server
- Kubernetes cluster with MiniKube in home server
- Migrating a Minecraft server to a new k8s infrastructure
- Python scripts in k8s
- Smou App wrapper to view availability, make reservations and pick up bikes directly from Telegram Bot, bypassing official app (hey, half of the time it doesn't work!)
- Update this site! (I'm going to forget about it)
- HomeAssistant and iot tinkering inside my home
- Nas integration
- DNS local server (maybe pihole)

And that should be everything! I have enough projects to get me entertained for a few weeks.

If you have any suggestions, or just want to say hi you can find me on my Github page or Linkedin. Always happy to meet new people!
