Graduated a few years ago in a degree on Telecommunications and Masters in CyberSecurity management. Right now I have my focus on Cloud Security but in the past I have done a few pentests, mostly regarding mobile applications. I will probably focus this site to my hobby side, so I don't thing you will find anything professional here. I learned most of my sysadmin and programming skills from tinkering with Telecogresca servers and applications but the real mvps are the giants that made IT shine in Telecogresca a few years ago. Thanks for the code left behind Arnau Alc\u00e1zar and \u00c0lex Barcel\u00f3 With my recently bought ChromeBox 4 I have a few cool projects in mind so hopefully I will document them here soon. Just as a quick list for myself, and nothing I promise working on soon, this is my project list: Asus ChromeBox 4 Deffy configuration and installation of Ubuntu server Kubernetes cluster with MiniKube in home server Migrating a Minecraft server to a new k8s infrastructure Python scripts in k8s Smou App wrapper to view availability, make reservations and pick up bikes directly from Telegram Bot, bypassing official app (hey, half of the time it doesn't work!) Update this site! (I'm going to forget about it) HomeAssistant and iot tinkering inside my home Nas integration DNS local server (maybe pihole) And that should be everything! I have enough projects to get me entertained for a few weeks. If you have any suggestions, or just want to say hi you can find me on my Github page or Linkedin. Always happy to meet new people!","title":"WhoAmI"},{"location":"whoami/#whoami","text":"Hi, I'm Nil Torres a professional in the CyberSecurity space.
